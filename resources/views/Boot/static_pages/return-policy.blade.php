				<p>
					Boot&#39;s returns and exchange policy gives you an option to return or exchange items purchased on Boot for any reason within 30 days of receipt of the item. We only ask that you don&#39;t use the product and preserve its original condition, tags, and packaging. You are welcome to try on a product but please take adequate measure to preserve its condition. There are two ways to return the product to us:
				</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Pick up: In most locations, we offer a free pick up service. You will see a pickup option when you submit a return request.
					</li>
					<li>
						Self-Ship: If we don&#39;t offer a pick up at your location. In such cases, we will credit the shipping costs into your PhonePe wallet provided the product meets the return policy and you have shared scan copy of the courier receipt with us.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>
					Once we pick up and receive your returned product, we will do a quality check of the product at our end and once product passes the quality check we will credit the amount you paid for the products into the refund mode selected at the time of initiating return request. If the picked up product does not pass the quality check, we shall ship it back to you. 
					If you choose to exchange the item for reason of mismatch of size or receipt of a defective item, you will be provided with a replacement of the item, free of cost. However all exchanges are subject to stock availability and subject to your address being serviceable for an exchange. If you choose to exchange an item, our delivery representative will deliver the new item to you and simultaneously pick up the original item from you. Please note that we are only able to offer size exchanges. If you wish to exchange your item for an alternative product, we suggest that you return it to obtain refund and purchase the new item separately.
