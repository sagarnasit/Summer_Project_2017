						Processing a Return with Packing Slip
					</b>
				</h3>
				<p>
					The packing slip received in your shipment includes a return form and shipping label for your convenience. If you retained these forms, please follow the instructions below to process your return:
				</p>

				<p>A.     Securely pack your item(s) in your original box or another box. Ensure labels are removed if you use the original box.</p>

				<p>B.     Fill in the “RETURN DETAIL” page of your packing slip. In the items list, write a return reason code (provided on the form) and the quantity for each item from the order that is being returned.</p>

				<p>Return reasons are as follows:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Size too small</li>
					<li>Size too big</li>
					<li>Overall fit issue</li>
					<li>Damaged / Defective</li>
					<li>Color faded / Discolored</li>
					<li>Not as pictured</li>
					<li>Order delayed</li>
					<li>Damaged in transit</li>
					<li>Duplicate style / shipment</li>
					<li>General return / Gift</li>
					<li>Connectivity Issues</li>
				</ol>

				<p>C.     Put the “RETURN DETAIL” page into the box before sealing it.</p>

				<p>D.     Seal the package.</p>

				<p>E.     Affix the return shipping label on the outside of the box.</p>

				<p>The address is on your pre-printed label. All returns must be sent with proper documentation to:</p>

				<div><b>FOS</b></div>

				<div><b>ATTN: Web Returns</b></div>

				<div><b>3901 W Miller Rd Suite 100</b></div>
